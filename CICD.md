This file states the CICD pipeline required for submission


    Code repository: The code for the Temporal app has been stored in a version control system as recommended already.

    Continuous Integration: Every time code is pushed to the repository, a CI system such as Jenkins, CircleCI or TravisCI can be triggered to build and test the code. The CI system can perform tasks such as:
        Lint the code to check for syntax and style errors.
        Run automated tests on the code to ensure it meets the required quality standards.
        Package the code into a Docker image.

    Continuous Deployment: If the CI process is successful, the CD process can be triggered to deploy the code to production. The CD process can use tools such as Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or Docker Compose to deploy the Docker image.

This is a basic CICD pipeline for this Temporal app. Depending on the specific requirements, the pipeline can be customized to include additional stages such as code analysis, security testing, and performance testing by the teams.
